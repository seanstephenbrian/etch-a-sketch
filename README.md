# [pointillist etch-a-sketch](https://seanstephenbrian.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

an early javascript project: an 'etch-a-sketch'-inspired interactive drawing tool highlighting
methods of event-driven DOM manipulation.

the interactive sketch field allows the user to recreate the masterpieces of art history that are
visible on the left side of the page. controls are provided to change the pixel size, switch between square- or circle-shaped pixels, and change the color of the sketch marks.
